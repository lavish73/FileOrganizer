# File Organizer Application

This Python program is a GUI-based tool designed to organize files within a selected directory. It categorizes files by type (e.g., Videos, Audios, Documents) and moves them into appropriately named folders. The program uses the `os` library for file operations and `tkinter` for the graphical interface.
